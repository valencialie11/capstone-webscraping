# Webscraping Capstone

Hi! This is a webscraping capstone project for my Data Analytics specialisation course. I used Beautifulsoup4 to help scrap data from the IMDB website.

Challenges:
1. It took a while to get used to the HTML tags and elements, considering I have not touched HTML since 7-8 years ago.
2. It was hard to extract data from IMDB website because it is not in a proper table form.
3. Some data in the website, like the meta scores, are missing.
4. Since I was a beginner in BeautifulSoup4, I had to rely on a lot of googling to help me with this project
5. LOTS and LOTS of frustrations whenever my codes don't work!

But... The more challenging the work, the more rewarding it is :)
I'm super thankful to be able to embark in this project. This project helped me to regain my passion in pursuing Data Science that I thought I had lost during this increasingly frustrating pandemic. 

May this kickstart a new journey and I'm excited to spend my holiday before university to do more individual projects! (maybe webcrawling next? or sth crazy and weird and non-datasci projects like building games and websites? who knows!)

See you~
